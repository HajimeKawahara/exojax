#Taken from https://www.chem.ualberta.ca/~massspec/atomic_mass_abund.pdf The isotopic mass data is from G. Audi, A. H. Wapstra Nucl. Phys A. 1993, 565, 1-65 and G. Audi, A. H. Wapstra Nucl. Phys A. 1995, 595, 409-480.  The percent natural abundance data is from the 1997 report of the IUPAC Subcommittee for Isotopic Abundance Measurements by K.J.R. Rosman, P.D.P. Taylor Pure Appl. Chem. 1999, 71, 1593-1607.

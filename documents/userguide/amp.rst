Atmospheric Microphysics (``amp``)
===========================================

For cloud modeling, atmospheric microphysics (``amp``) can be used. 
Currently, the Ackerman and Marley cloud model (``AmpAmcloud``) is available.
``amp`` is still in the early stages of construction.


Ackerman and Marley (AM) Cloud Model
---------------------------------------

The method ``amp.calc_ammodel`` calculates the rg parameter and the condensate's mass mixing ratio based on the AM cloud model.

Refer to 
:doc:`../tutorials/Ackerman_and_Marley_cloud_model`
for how to use ``AmpAmcloud``.

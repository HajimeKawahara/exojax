# How to contribute to exojax

## Branch model and pull-request (PR)

We adopt a simple git-flow model, consisting of master, develop, contributor-defined branches. PR by contributors via a folked repository is always welcome.

- master: stable branch. Once a set of functions is implemented in the **develop** branch, the maintainer (@HajimeKawahara) will merge them to the master branch through the release process (release branch).

- develop: default branch for developers. PR by contributors will be merged to this branch, after the review process.

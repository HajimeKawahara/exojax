# Tests

## unittests
Unit tests, but parts of the integration tests that do not take long computation time are included.
The real molecular database should not be used in the code. 
We frequently test the codes in this category when writing code. 

## integration
Integration test. Longer computation time and/or use real molecular database are allowed.

## endtoend
End-to-end test. It takes much longer time than integration tests/unit tests.

## figures
Some codes for making figures

## benchmark
codes for benchmarking
